# Airfare Price Prediction using Random Forest

## Overview

This Python project implements a machine learning model for predicting airfare prices using the Random Forest algorithm. The goal is to assist travelers in estimating potential flight costs based on historical flight data. The Random Forest model is trained on features such as departure city, destination, date of travel, etc., to make accurate predictions about future airfare prices. The project provides clear instructions for installation, usage, and model training, making it accessible for users interested in predicting airfare prices for their travel planning.
